idk how to upload a virtual environment with all of the correct libraries to run this code, but here's the code that I generated.
At some point, I think we will be able to stray away from having to use a virtual environment, but for the time being, that's
the only way that I've been able to figure out how to do this.
I'll create some instructions on how to set up a virtual environment to run this at some point as well, so that we can all run this.
or not. idk.

I'm currently making instructions on how to replicate making a virtual environment, however THEY ARE NOT COMPLETE yet.



*** DO NOT PUSH YOUR '.venv' VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT TO GITHUB ***
(or do it. idk if it'll really do much tbh. we can just delete the folder anyways)



(1) SETTING UP THE PYTHON MACHINE LEARNING STUFF (you should only have to do this once. i think)

    * Download Python
        I think I just downloaded the most recent version using vscode, but it shouldn't matter how you download it.

    * Download pip (maybe)
        Idk if I needed to download pip or not, but you may need to if the pip commands do not work in step 3. So
        try that first, and then come back and do this if needed.


(2) Instructions To Set Up Virtual Environment:

    * For Windows, type the following in terminal:
        $ python -m venv .venv
    OR...
    * For Mac, type the following in terminal:
        $ python3 -m venv .venv

    This should create a file called '.venv' that will contain all of your local libraries and stuff for this project.



(3) Instructions To Install Neccessary Libraries:
    
    * type the following in terminal:
        $ pip install opencv-contrib-python
        $ pip install cvlib
    
    This should download the neccessary libraries that we use for the opencv machine learning model. Not all of the files
    in these libraries are used, but I guess they're good to have. idk.
