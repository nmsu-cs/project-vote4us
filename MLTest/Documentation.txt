*** INTRODUCTION ***

These are instructions that should hopefully walk you through the steps of getting everything
set up for running the python files.



*** IMPORTANT FOR MAC USERS (maybe) ***

My environment that I'm using is Windows, so some things that I mention, like 'Powershell'
are specific to windows. If you are on mac, you shouldn't have to worry about that step.
I am also using visual studio code for this stuff. It isn't neccessary, but it might make
some of these steps easier to follow along.



*** DO NOT PUSH YOUR '.venv' VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT TO GITHUB ***
(or do it. idk if it'll really do much tbh. we can just delete the folder anyways)



*** STEPS FOR SETTING UP PYTHON MACHINE LEARNING ***

(1) Downloading Neccessities
     
    Some of this stuff, you may have already done. If you have, you don't need to do it.
    If you aren't sure, I'd just do it to be safe.


    * Download Python
        - Download python from 'python.org' (I got the 3.12.3 version, which was recommended).

        - I wouldn't reccommend downloading from the vscode-integrated system, or from microsoft
          store (which are the same thing). This caused issues for me when using pip.


    * Download Windows PowerShell (not for Mac)
        - Click the extensions tab on vscode's left-hand bar. type in 'PowerShell' into the
          search bar, press enter, and select the 'PowerShell' extension. Click install.

        - I believe this is what was giving me issues, when installing using pip.
        


(2) Pull Repository From GITHUB
    
    You may have already done this. That is fine. It is ideal to have created a directory
    and then clone the repo from this directory. This means that a folder will contain the
    'project-vote4us' folder.


    Create a new terminal in vscode:
        - This should be in the top bar, just click terminal.
    

    Type the following in the terminal:
        $ git clone 'the_github_ssh_key'
        
        - This should have cloned our repository.



(3) Instructions To Set Up Virtual Environment

    First Navigate To The Parent Folder In Terminal:
        - ideally you should have a folder encapsulating the 'project-vote4us' folder.
          If not, it should be fine if you are just working in the 'project-vote4us' folder.
    
    
    Honestly, I started making steps, but just follow this guy's tutorial:
    (WATCH TO THE END!!)

    - You can delete the test python file you created when you're done.
    


(3) Instructions To Install Neccessary Libraries:
    
    * type the following in terminal:
        $ pip install opencv-contrib-python
        $ pip install cvlib
    
    This should download the neccessary libraries that we use for the opencv machine learning
    model. You can check that they've been installed correctly when you open the folder,
    '/.venv/Lib/site-packages/'
    There should be a long list of librarias that we don't really use all of.
